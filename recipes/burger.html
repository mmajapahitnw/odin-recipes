        <h2>How to Make Basic Beef Burger Patties</h2>

        <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:</p>

        <p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.</p>

        <p>Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p>

        <h2>How to Store Beef Burgers</h2>

        <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>

        <p>"We've made these a few times now and the kids love it every time," shares home cook Christel K. "Despite the basic ingredients list it's an absolutely delicious burger, especially when dressed up with some toppings! We add spinach, old cheddar cheese, onions, pickles, plus mustard and mayo."</p>

        <p>"Followed the recipe closely — good hamburgers," says dwolk. "One note of which to be aware: The recipe calls for 6-8 minutes a side! My ordinary outdoor propane three-burner grill: 3-4 a side and more than medium-rare."</p>

        <p>"Pretty respectable burger, says reviewer berrymoore. "I think I'll add a little onion powder next time to add a little more depth to the flavor."</p>
